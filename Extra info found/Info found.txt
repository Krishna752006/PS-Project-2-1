The Wrapper and Ranker technique was used to choose the top features before categorization.

Clustering is used to categorize confusing batting statistics from the Indian Premier League. 

Some other researchers proposed an algorithm called cricAI.

The main drawback of the above mentioned problems was that if the match gets affected by rain or some other issues then the prediction becomes somewhat tough because the over may get reduced or points may get shared etc.., so in this research paper we proposed a classifier which can predict such matches also and give the accurate results than the other previous models.

If there is a new player or a new team entry based upon their ODI matches scores or
wickets are considered for the prediction of the accuracy.

To choose points, the Boruta()and significance() methods are utilised.

This process is called label encoding.

Precision:
Precision is the proportion of correctly predicted positive observations versus the total number of positively predicted observations. Precision talks about how precise a model is out of predicted positive, how many of them are actual positive.


Recall:
Recall is the proportion of number of correctly predicted positive observations versus total number of all actual observations.

Accuracy:
Accuracy can be calculated as the average of Precision and Recall.
