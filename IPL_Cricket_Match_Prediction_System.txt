IPL Cricket Match Prediction System Using MERN Stack, Machine Learning/Deep Learning

Project Overview
Develop a web application to predict outcomes of IPL cricket matches using historical match data. 
The system will use the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) for the web application and 
integrate Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models for the prediction functionality.

Project Objective
	Store and manage IPL match data using database. Can use the data to provide visual insights and statistics.
Provide rich UI which  allow users to query predictions for upcoming matches.
The major objective in addition to above is to Use ML and DL models to predict match outcomes.

Technical Stack
Frontend: React.js
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB

Data Ingestion and Storage. Collect and store IPL match data in MongoDB.

Basic Level: Machine Learning Model
Task: Train ML models to predict match outcomes.
Features: Feature engineering from match data.
Train models such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression.
Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall.

Advanced Level: Deep Learning Model

Task: Train DL models for more complex predictions.
Features:
Implement neural networks (e.g., RNN, LSTM) to predict outcomes.
Create APIs to serve predictions.
