# IPL Prediction System using LSTM

Developing a web application to predict outcomes of IPL cricket matches using historical match data. This system will use the MERN stack for the web application and integrate Deep Learning (DL) models like LSTM and RNN for the prediction functionality.

## Deployment

To run this project, The user must be having node and express installed. Then need to go to the src folder and type the following commands in the terminal or powershell.

FIrst go to src folder, for which type the command

```bash
    cd src
```

Then we need to make sure that flask has an environment to run in. If it is not there, we need to run the following commands:

### In Windows

```bash
    $env:FLASK_APP = "model.py"
```
### In Mac

```bash
    export FLASK_APP="model.py"
```

### Then run

```bash
    flask run
```

In another ternimal run

```bash
